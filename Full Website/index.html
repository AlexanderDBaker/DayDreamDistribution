Mr. Kasperzak called this invention Calphalon.

Eventually, demand for Calphalon cookware grew so great that it became available through department specialty stores as well. The retail release of this product was supported by an unprecedented program of consumer education, which included in-store demonstrations, culinary event sponsorships, cookbooks, and a wealth of other informative literature catering to home chefs.</p>

                                        A multinational manufacturer and marketer for home appliances, Whirlpool has its headquarters in Michigan, United States with more than 70 manufacturing and technology research centers found all around the world. Started in 1911, Whirlpool started off as a machine shop known as the Upton Machine Company. The first product included a manual clothes washer which then evolved into one with an electric motor. This is then when the company started producing  electric motor-driven wringer washers. In 1929, Upton merged with the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company from New York which then introduced the automatic, spinner-type washers in 1947. The following year, the company was sold under the brand name Whirlpool.</p>

                                              <p align="justify">
                                                A multinational manufacturer and marketer for home appliances, Whirlpool has its headquarters in Michigan, United States with more than 70 manufacturing and technology research centers found all around the world. Started in 1911, Whirlpool started off as a machine shop known as the Upton Machine Company. The first product included a manual clothes washer which then evolved into one with an electric motor. This is then when the company started producing  electric motor-driven wringer washers. In 1929, Upton merged with the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company from New York which then introduced the automatic, spinner-type washers in 1947. The following year, the company was sold under the brand name Whirlpool.</p>
